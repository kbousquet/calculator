## Calculator

![Screenshot of a Calculator on a Webpage](img.png)

Implementation of a basic calculator from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

This is my third **JS** project. Click [here](https://kbousquet.github.io/calculator) for the **Live version** of the game.

Trying to get the calculator logic for this project was particularly challenging but rewarding once I began to understand it.
I also gained more understanding of CSS grid.
