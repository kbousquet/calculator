Implementation of a basic calculator from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

With this calculator, you're able to chain multiple operations together. Each result is stored as an input for the next operation.


Trying to get the calculator logic for this project was particularly challenging but rewarding once I began to understand it.


In this project:
* Gained more understanding of CSS grid
* Added keyboard support by Learning how to link up keyboard event listeners
* Refactored code to prevent redundancy and increase readability
